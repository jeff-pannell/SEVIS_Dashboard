## SEVIS Dashboard Readme

This is a dashboard I made for the Wizual Wednesdays on the International Office Connection. It's assembled using dummy data in the format of a download file from SEVIS, Quarto, and R. It's an ongoing project, and I'll continue posting progress on the [International Office Connection website](https://iofficeconsulting.mn.co/).
